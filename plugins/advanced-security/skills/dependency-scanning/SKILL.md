# Dependency Vulnerability Scanning Skill

## Overview

This skill uses the GitHub MCP Server's Dependabot toolset and the `check_dependency_vulnerabilities` tool to find known vulnerabilities in project dependencies. It can check existing Dependabot alerts, look up specific packages, and verify new dependencies before merging.

### What counts as a dependency vulnerability?

Dependency vulnerabilities are known security flaws (CVEs) in third-party packages your project depends on. Examples include:
- Outdated npm packages with remote code execution flaws
- Python libraries with SQL injection vulnerabilities
- Go modules with denial-of-service weaknesses
- Ruby gems with authentication bypass issues
- Transitive dependencies inheriting upstream vulnerabilities

### Why this is important

A single vulnerable dependency can allow remote code execution in your application, enable denial-of-service attacks, expose sensitive data through library flaws, fail compliance audits (SOC 2, PCI-DSS, HIPAA), or introduce supply chain attack vectors.

**Important**: Only use this skill when a user explicitly asks to check dependencies or scan for vulnerabilities. Do not run dependency scanning unprompted or as part of general workflows.

## Common Scenarios

| User goal | How to respond | Tools needed |
|---|---|---|
| Check existing alerts | Check Dependabot Alerts | MCP only |
| Check a specific package | Look Up a Specific Package | MCP only |
| Verify new deps before pushing | Scan Local Branch Changes | Bash + MCP |
| Full dependency audit | Audit All Dependencies | Bash + MCP |
| Deterministic post-commit check | Post-Commit Safety Net | `dependabot` CLI + MCP |

**Lightweight vs. heavyweight operations**: For lightweight operations (checking alerts, looking up a package), proceed automatically. For heavyweight operations (downloading the Dependabot CLI, running a full repository audit), ask the user for confirmation before proceeding.

### Check Dependabot Alerts

**When to use**: The repository is hosted on GitHub and has Dependabot enabled.

**How**:

List all open alerts:

```
Use the list_dependabot_alerts tool:
  owner: <repo-owner>
  repo: <repo-name>
  state: open
```

This returns all open Dependabot alerts including package name, ecosystem, severity, CVE identifiers, and patched version (if available).

Get details on a specific alert:

```
Use the get_dependabot_alert tool:
  owner: <repo-owner>
  repo: <repo-name>
  alert_number: <number>
```

This returns the vulnerability description, CVSS score, affected version range, fixed version, and advisory links.

**Fallback**: If Dependabot is not enabled on the repository, fall back to "Look Up a Specific Package" below.

**Example (vulnerabilities found)**
```
You: Check my repo for dependency vulnerabilities
Agent: Fetching Dependabot alerts...
       Found 3 open alerts:
       1. Critical — lodash@4.17.15 (CVE-2021-23337: Command Injection) → Fix: 4.17.21
       2. High — express@4.17.1 (CVE-2024-29041: Open Redirect) → Fix: 4.18.2
       3. Medium — axios@0.21.1 (CVE-2021-3749: ReDoS) → Fix: 0.21.2
```

**Example (no alerts)**
```
You: Check my repo for dependency vulnerabilities
Agent: Fetching Dependabot alerts...
       ✅ No open Dependabot alerts found for this repository.
```

### Look Up a Specific Package

**When to use**: Checking a specific package/version before adding it, or when Dependabot is not available.

**How**: Use the `check_dependency_vulnerabilities` tool with a single dependency:

```
Use the check_dependency_vulnerabilities tool:
  owner: <repo-owner>
  repo: <repo-name>
  dependencies:
    - name: <package-name>
      version: <version>
      ecosystem: <ecosystem>
```

Supported ecosystem values: `npm`, `pip`, `maven`, `nuget`, `composer`, `pub`, `actions`, `bundler`, `gomod`, `cargo`, `hex`, `swift`.

The tool checks for high-severity, critical-severity, and malware advisories in the GitHub Advisory Database.

**Example**:
```
You: Is lodash 4.17.15 safe to use?
Agent: ⚠️ lodash@4.17.15 has 1 known vulnerability:
       - CVE-2021-23337 (Critical): Command Injection via template function
         Fixed in: 4.17.21 — Recommendation: Update to lodash>=4.17.21
```

### Scan Local Branch Changes

**When to use**: The current branch adds or updates dependencies and you want to check them before pushing.

**Steps**:
1. Detect which dependency files changed on this branch
2. For each changed manifest/lockfile, parse the new or updated dependencies
3. Check them with `check_dependency_vulnerabilities` (batch up to 30 per call)

**Step 1 — Detect changed dependency files**:

```bash
# Check which dependency files changed on the current branch vs base
# Filter out vendor, build, and generated directories
git diff --name-only origin/main...HEAD \
  | grep -v -E '(^|/)vendor/' \
  | grep -v -E '(^|/)node_modules/' \
  | grep -v -E '(^|/)(build|dist|out|target)/' \
  | grep -E \
  '(package\.json|package-lock\.json|yarn\.lock|pnpm-lock\.yaml|requirements\.txt|Pipfile\.lock|poetry\.lock|pyproject\.toml|setup\.py|go\.mod|go\.sum|Gemfile|Gemfile\.lock|Cargo\.toml|Cargo\.lock|pom\.xml|build\.gradle|build\.gradle\.kts|.*\.csproj|packages\.config|composer\.json|composer\.lock|pubspec\.yaml|pubspec\.lock|Package\.swift|Package\.resolved)'
```

If no dependency files changed, no further scanning is needed — exit early.

**Example (clean)**
```
You: Check if the new dependencies on this branch are safe
Agent: Scanning package-lock.json changes...
       ✅ All new dependencies are clean — no known vulnerabilities found.
```

**Example (vulnerabilities found)**
```
You: Check if the new dependencies on this branch are safe
Agent: Scanning package-lock.json changes...
       ⚠️ Found 1 vulnerability in newly added dependencies:
       - lodash@4.17.15: Critical — CVE-2021-23337 (Command Injection) → Fix: 4.17.21
```

### Audit All Dependencies

**When to use**: Running a full supply chain security audit of the entire project.

> **Ask the user for confirmation before proceeding.** Example: "This will scan all dependency files in the repository. For large projects this may take a few minutes. Would you like me to proceed?"

**Step 1 — Discover all dependency files**:

**Supported ecosystems and manifest files**:
- **npm**: `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`
- **pip**: `requirements.txt`, `Pipfile.lock`, `poetry.lock`, `pyproject.toml`, `setup.py`
- **Go**: `go.mod`, `go.sum`
- **RubyGems**: `Gemfile`, `Gemfile.lock`
- **Rust**: `Cargo.toml`, `Cargo.lock`
- **Maven**: `pom.xml`, `build.gradle`, `build.gradle.kts`
- **NuGet**: `*.csproj`, `packages.config`, `*.deps.json`
- **Composer**: `composer.json`, `composer.lock`
- **Pub**: `pubspec.yaml`, `pubspec.lock`
- **Swift**: `Package.swift`, `Package.resolved`

Search up to 4 directories deep, excluding `node_modules/`, `.git/`, and `vendor/`.

**Step 2 — Parse and check dependencies**:

For each discovered manifest/lockfile, parse the dependency names, versions, and ecosystem, then check them with `check_dependency_vulnerabilities` (batch up to 30 per call):

```
Use the check_dependency_vulnerabilities tool:
  owner: <repo-owner>
  repo: <repo-name>
  dependencies:
    - name: <package-1>
      version: <version-1>
      ecosystem: <ecosystem>
    - name: <package-2>
      version: <version-2>
      ecosystem: <ecosystem>
    ...
```

Map manifest files to ecosystem values: `package.json`/`yarn.lock`/`pnpm-lock.yaml` → `npm`, `requirements.txt`/`Pipfile.lock`/`poetry.lock`/`pyproject.toml` → `pip`, `go.mod`/`go.sum` → `gomod`, `Gemfile`/`Gemfile.lock` → `bundler`, `Cargo.toml`/`Cargo.lock` → `cargo`, `pom.xml`/`build.gradle` → `maven`, `*.csproj`/`packages.config` → `nuget`, `composer.json`/`composer.lock` → `composer`, `pubspec.yaml`/`pubspec.lock` → `pub`, `Package.swift`/`Package.resolved` → `swift`.

**Example**
```
You: Audit all dependencies in this repository for security issues
Agent: Discovering dependency files...
       Found: package-lock.json, poetry.lock, go.sum
       Scan Results:
       - npm: 2 vulnerabilities (1 high, 1 medium)
       - pip: 0 vulnerabilities
       - Go: 1 vulnerability (1 low)
       Total: 3 vulnerabilities across 3 ecosystems
```

### Post-Commit Safety Net (Advanced)

**When to use**: After the agent commits changes, before merge — a deterministic backstop that ensures nothing slips through.

> **If the Dependabot CLI is not already installed, ask the user before downloading it.** Example: "This check requires the Dependabot CLI (~50MB). Would you like me to download and install it?"

┌──────────────────────────────┐
│  5. Report & Re-iterate      │  Report vulns; agent iterates to fix
└──────────────────────────────┘
```

#### Step 1: Detect Changed Manifest/Lockfiles

Use the same `git diff` command from "Scan Local Branch Changes" above. If no dependency files changed, exit early.

#### Step 2: Build Before/After Dependency Graphs

Map changed files to Dependabot CLI ecosystem values (using the ecosystem table in "Audit All Dependencies" above — e.g., `package.json` → `npm_and_yarn`, `go.mod` → `go_modules`, `Gemfile` → `bundler`).

```bash
ECOSYSTEM="npm_and_yarn"  # set based on the mapping table above

# Use a git worktree to get the base commit without modifying the working tree
git worktree add /tmp/base-ref origin/main --detach 2>/dev/null

# Build dependency graph at the base commit (before changes)
dependabot graph $ECOSYSTEM /tmp/base-ref --output=/tmp/before-deps.json

# Build dependency graph at current HEAD (after changes)
dependabot graph $ECOSYSTEM . --output=/tmp/after-deps.json

# Clean up the worktree
git worktree remove /tmp/base-ref 2>/dev/null
```

> **Note:** Replace `origin/main` with your base branch. You can extract `<owner>/<repo>` from your git remote: `git remote get-url origin | sed -E 's|.*github\.com[:/]([^/]+/[^/]+?)(\.git)?$|\1|'`

#### Step 3: Diff New/Updated Dependencies

The `dependabot graph` output is a JSON object with a `dependencies` array. Each entry has `name`, `version`, and `relationship` (`"direct"` or `"transitive"`).

```bash
python3 -c "
import json

# Load before/after dependency graphs produced by 'dependabot graph'
with open('/tmp/before-deps.json') as f:
    before_data = json.load(f)
with open('/tmp/after-deps.json') as f:
    after_data = json.load(f)

# Extract direct dependencies from the graph output
def get_direct_deps(data):
    deps = {}
    for dep in data.get('dependencies', []):
        if dep.get('relationship') == 'direct':
            deps[dep['name']] = dep['version']
    return deps

before = get_direct_deps(before_data)
after = get_direct_deps(after_data)

# Find new or version-changed direct dependencies
changed = []
for name, version in after.items():
    if name not in before:
        changed.append({'name': name, 'version': version, 'change': 'added'})
    elif before[name] != version:
        changed.append({'name': name, 'version': version, 'change': f'updated from {before[name]}'})

print(json.dumps(changed, indent=2))
print(f'\n{len(changed)} direct dependencies added or updated')
"
```

#### Step 4: Check Against Advisory Database

Feed the changed dependencies from Step 3 into the `check_dependency_vulnerabilities` tool (batch up to 30 per call):

```
Use the check_dependency_vulnerabilities tool:
  owner: <repo-owner>
  repo: <repo-name>
  dependencies:
    - name: <changed-dep-1>
      version: <version>
      ecosystem: <ecosystem>
    - name: <changed-dep-2>
      version: <version>
      ecosystem: <ecosystem>
    ...
```

Map the Dependabot CLI ecosystem to `check_dependency_vulnerabilities` ecosystem values: `npm_and_yarn` → `npm`, `pip` → `pip`, `go_modules` → `gomod`, `bundler` → `bundler`, `cargo` → `cargo`, `maven` → `maven`, `nuget` → `nuget`, `composer` → `composer`, `pub` → `pub`, `swift` → `swift`.

#### Step 5: Report Vulnerabilities and Re-Iterate

If vulnerabilities are found, report them back to the agent with specific remediation instructions. The agent should fix the vulnerable dependencies and the check runs again — repeating until all newly-introduced vulnerabilities are resolved.

```
Vulnerable dependencies detected in your changes:

1. lodash@4.17.15 (added in package.json)
   - GHSA-35jh-r3h4-6jhm: Command Injection (Critical, CVSS 9.8)
   - Fixed in: 4.17.21
   - Action: Update to lodash@4.17.21 in package.json

2. requests@2.25.0 (added in requirements.txt)
   - GHSA-j8r2-6x86-q33q: Proxy-Authorization header leak (Medium, CVSS 6.1)
   - Fixed in: 2.31.0
   - Action: Update to requests>=2.31.0 in requirements.txt

Please fix these vulnerabilities and commit the changes. The check will re-run automatically.
```

> **Key insight**: Running this as a *post-result* hook (after the agent commits) is more reliable than a pre-commit hook. Pre-commit hooks cause agents to add warnings to the PR description rather than actually fixing the vulnerability.

**Example**
```
[Agent finishes work and commits changes]
Hook: Detecting changed dependency files...
      Changed: package-lock.json
      Building dependency graphs with `dependabot graph`...
      3 direct dependencies added: lodash (new) 4.17.15, axios 0.21.1→1.6.0, express 4.17.1→4.18.2
      1 vulnerability found — requesting agent fix:
      - Critical — lodash@4.17.15 (GHSA-35jh-r3h4-6jhm: Command Injection → Fix: 4.17.21)
Agent: Updating package.json to use lodash@4.17.21... ✅ Fixed. Committing changes.
Hook: ✅ All newly-introduced dependencies are clean.
```

## Reporting Results

The `check_dependency_vulnerabilities` tool returns a formatted report with ✓/⚠ per dependency, GHSA IDs, severity, and summaries. Present this output directly to the user, supplemented with remediation guidance.

### Severity Legend

| Severity | CVSS Score | Action |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| Critical | 9.0–10.0 | Fix immediately |
| High | 7.0–8.9 | Fix as soon as possible |
| Medium | 4.0–6.9 | Schedule fix |
| Low | 0.1–3.9 | Track and fix when convenient |

For automated remediation, only block on **Critical** and **High** severity. Medium and low issues should be reported but should not block the agent's work. Focus remediation on direct dependencies (listed in manifests). Transitive dependencies require updating the parent to a version that pulls in the patched transitive dep, or adding `resolutions` (Yarn), `overrides` (npm), or equivalent. For each vulnerability, provide the exact package and target version, the fix command, any breaking-change warnings, and a mitigation if no patch exists.


## Installation

### Prerequisites & Inputs

1. **GitHub MCP Server**: The skill requires the GitHub MCP Server with the `dependabot` toolset enabled.

   Configure in your MCP settings:
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "github": {
         "type": "http",
         "url": "https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/"
       }
     }
   }
   ```

   > **Note:** Cursor uses `servers` instead of `mcpServers` as the top-level key.

**Required information for scanning**:
- **Repository owner**: Usually available from `git remote get-url origin` or ask the user
- **Repository name**: Usually available from `git remote get-url origin` or ask the user

2. **Optional — Dependabot CLI**: Required for the Post-Commit Safety Net use case. Ask the user before downloading.

   ```bash
   # Check if already installed
   which dependabot 2>/dev/null && dependabot --version

   # Install via Go
   go install github.com/dependabot/cli/cmd/dependabot@latest

   # Or download a prebuilt binary from GitHub releases (Linux/macOS/Windows, amd64/arm64)
   # https://github.com/dependabot/cli/releases
   PLATFORM="linux"   # or "darwin" or "windows"
   ARCH="amd64"       # or "arm64"
   VERSION=$(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/dependabot/cli/releases/latest | grep tag_name | cut -d '"' -f4)
   curl -fsSL -o dependabot.tar.gz \
     "https://github.com/dependabot/cli/releases/download/${VERSION}/dependabot-${VERSION}-${PLATFORM}-${ARCH}.tar.gz"
   tar xzf dependabot.tar.gz
   chmod +x dependabot
   mv dependabot /usr/local/bin/
   ```

## Scanning Transparency

### How your data is processed

- **Dependabot alerts approach**: Only the repository owner/name is sent to the GitHub MCP Server. Dependency data is already stored by GitHub.
- **Vulnerability check approach**: Package names, versions, and ecosystems are sent to the GitHub MCP Server's `check_dependency_vulnerabilities` tool, which queries the GitHub Advisory Database.
- **Dependabot CLI approach**: Dependency information is processed locally. Network requests go to package registries.
